8. The user reviews the entered information and registers the employee in the system.
9. The user specifies the payroll calculation period (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.).
10. The system retrieves the attendance data for the specified period for each employee and performs payroll calculations.
11. The system generates individual salary statements for each employee, displaying detailed items such as base salary, allowances, bonuses, etc.
12. The user reviews the salary statements and makes any necessary modifications or additional adjustments.
