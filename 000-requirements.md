A user wants to use a document management system to perform the following tasks:

1. Document upload: The user needs to upload documents to the system. The uploaded documents may be in formats such as PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, etc. To upload, the user should be able to use the drag & drop or file selection function. Additionally, the uploaded documents can be tagged, making it easier to search for them in the future.

2. Document search: The user may need to search for a specific document. The search function should have options such as full-text search, keyword search, tag search, etc. When the user enters a search query, the system returns relevant documents. The search results should display information such as the document title, upload date, tags, etc.

3. Document viewing and download: The user should be able to select a document from the search results and view or download it. The system should provide a function to preview the document in the browser. The download function should include the option to download the document directly or to download the document as a ZIP file.

4. Access control: The documents uploaded by the user need to have access control if necessary. Access control includes functions such as sharing documents, setting users who can view or download documents, and managing user access rights. Access control should also have security features.

Backup and restore: The document management system should take regular backups and be able to restore them when necessary.
